    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "The three supervised models those can be useful in this are: GaussianNB, DecisionTree and GradientBoosting. \n",
    "1. *GaussianNB*\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - some real world application of NB would involve spam classifier, labeling various articles based on pre-defined labels. It can also be used for sentiment analysis for e.g. like twitter sentiment analysis if a tweet is positive/negative etc. \n",
    "   - NB algorithm works very well with smaller datasets . It fits the data well with providing good accuracy and f-scores. we have already seen in previous modules that the score (accuracy and f-score) outperform scores of other models. It is also easy to understand and the prediction by model can be explained as well. Other strength is computation time which is relatively small.\n",
    "   - As the name suggests this naive assumption of independent features are not true in real world scenario although in many cases this assumption does not impact much. . so we can not give a pre-defined threshold probability level for classification. This is a high bias and low variance model and prone to underfitting.\n",
    "   - As we do not have a large dataset and we have mix of continous as well as discrete features which makes GNB algorithm perfect as this model assumnes that features follow gaussian distribution (normal distribution). For simplicity, this model is also preferred than others. \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. *Decision Tree*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Decision tree is used in healthcare system to predict/detect cancer or any other diseases. it is also being used in fault detection of engineering appliances like motors, rotors etc. and in loan approval.\n",
    "    - This algorithm works well with medium to large datasets. The feature selection happen automatically in the model, no effort from user needed. This model is simple and easy to explain. \n",
    "    - This algorithm is prone to overfitting the data. Searching for right parameters can be computationally intensive.\n",
    "    - As we have mix of discrete and continous features, it would be difficult to predict most important feature to classify given so many variables after one-hot encoding. so this problem is overcome by DT as the feature selection process in automatic. DT also takes care of smaller/larger values or outliers or values distributed only in concentrated areas (Capital gain/loss).\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. *GradientBoosting*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - This model being an ensemble method, used in face detection.\n",
    "    - this model based on boosting which train weak learners and create one strong learner. This process is iterative where next clssifier is trained on already trained ensemble. This model can give very good f-score as well as accuracy.\n",
    "    - May prone to overfitting.\n",
    "    - this method deals well with numerical features as well as categorical features. This is an ensemble method based on boosting concept and the time required to train the model is very low as compared to RandomForest which is based on averging/voting of the weak learners.\n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",

    "   - For this dataset we chose DecisionTree algorithm. This model works by creating tree and branches of it which are basic building blocks of the chosen model. The tree choose one feature/independent variable which is best suitable for the dataset by looking at the relationship between that variable and 'income' (variable to be predicted). so let's assume that variable 1 separates the data well and we create two branches with 'income' as outcome i.e.while separating this variable 1 gives fewer errors compared with others and two branches represent one with 'income' <50K and with >50K. we continue in this fashion with other variable which fits the data well in the two created branches and we create sub-branches. This process is continued till some default/defined threshold of number of leaves or branches triggers. In the end, we will have a tree where at each point, we can make one of two decisions. Following a path leads to a decision. The split points will be chosen to maximize the probability of a correct classification. in this fashion the tree learns the training data and predict test set using the branching rules learned.\n",
    "   - This model tends to overfits i.e. it memorises the training set and thats why it does not perform well on test data however, with turning the various parameters like number of leaves, branches, depth of tree etc. we can arrive at a good tree which perform well in the testset as well. "

    "  - The score of the optimized model is better than the unoptimized model and far better compared to the naive predictor however the accuracy of the optimized model is lower than the naive predictor. The accuracy is a misleading score in case when there is significant difference between the classes we want to classify for e.g. in detecting fraud transctions among all the transctions, the amount of actual fraud is significantly lower than non-fraud transctions. in this case accuracy score is not a good predictor. \n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

The next best feature would be occupation as people working in technical/finance or basically skilled workers get paid more than unskilled workers. The next important predictor is hours per week as generally people working fulltime tends to earn more than othersand next would be capital gain. "

As per marital status is considered, it is closely related to age and education because with higher age and/or education people tends get married, hence higher the age/education, chances of marriage is more and so the income. so the marital status picked as top predictor may be justified given the above reason.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
